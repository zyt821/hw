Now I'll create a comprehensive README file to help you set up and use the system:</system_message>

I've successfully converted your compliance checking system to run asynchronously with full cancellation support. Here's what I've created:

## Summary of Changes

### 1. **Database Tables** (SQL file)
- `background_jobs` - Tracks job status, progress, and errors
- `job_cancel_flags` - Manages cancellation requests

### 2. **background_processor.php** (New File)
- Standalone script that runs in the background
- Performs the actual data comparison
- Checks for cancellation between processing batches
- Updates job progress in real-time

### 3. **Updated ExcelComparisonTool.php**
- Added `compareDataWithCancellation()` method
- Checks cancellation flag between processing batches
- Reports progress via callback function
- Returns `false` if cancelled

### 4. **Updated test11.php** (Main Application)
- File upload now creates a background job instead of processing synchronously
- Spawns background process using `exec()` or `shell_exec()`
- AJAX-based progress monitoring
- Cancel button with confirmation
- Real-time progress bar

## Key Features

**Background Execution**: Uses `exec()` with output redirection to run PHP scripts in the background without blocking the user interface.

**Cancellation System**: Database-based flag that the background process checks between batches (every 1000 records by default). This is safe and doesn't require signals or process management.

**Progress Tracking**: The background process updates its progress percentage in the database, which the frontend polls every 2 seconds via AJAX.

**Error Handling**: Failed jobs store error messages, and all logs are saved to individual files in the `logs/` directory.

**Memory Management**: Processes data in batches with garbage collection to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Important Notes

1. **PHP Path**: The code uses `PHP_BINARY` constant. If this doesn't work in your environment, you'll need to hardcode the PHP binary path in `startBackgroundProcessing()`.

2. **File Permissions**: Make sure `background_processor.php` is executable and the web server can write to `logs/` and `exports/` directories.

3. **Cleanup**: Old jobs are automatically cleaned up after 24 hours. You can adjust this in the `cleanupOldResults()` and `cleanupOldCsvData()` function calls.

4. **Windows vs Linux**: The code detects the OS and uses the appropriate command syntax (`start /B` for Windows, `&` for Linux).

The system is now fully asynchronous and allows users to cancel long-running jobs at any time!
